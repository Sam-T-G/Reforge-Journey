        <h2>revitalizing and transcending my coding skills</h2>
        <p>Nearly a year ago, I finished my full-stack coding bootcamp but wasn't able to pursue a career in software engineering due to various personal and financial reasons. I'm now ready and motivated to reinvigorate my skills to take tangible, conistent steps towards a career change.</p>

            <h3>Revisiting Code - Starting with HTML</h3>
            <p>The first step in my coding journey begins with the absolute basics -HTML. I brushed up on general HTML knowledge, starting with familiarizing myself with the basic structure. and slowly worked in applying classes, divs, and outlining the text content throughout this page.</p>

        <section class="css" id="css">
            <h4>Back to My Design Roots - CSS</h4>
            <p>Along with basic HTML elements, I slowly re-familiarized myself on how to apply styling through CSS. I started with creating an aesthetically pleasing landing page for this project. I changed the default font, added colors, adjusted spacing and sizes, and also created a basic navigation bar that was accessible as the user scrolls down the page.</p>
