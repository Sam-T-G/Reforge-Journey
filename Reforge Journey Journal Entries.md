Reforge Journey Journal Entries

This text file marks the beginning of my journey to reacclimate and recommit to my previous passion and desire to undergo a career change in software engineering.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to re-acclimate my acquired knowledge of coding from the UCLA Extension Bootcamp I enrolled and completed approximately one year ago. Navigating and even taking the first steps to change my career from a self employed photographer to being a software engineer has been very difficult due to the balancing of time allocation and finiancial obligations needed to survive in the modern age. This project will be an exercise in my commitment to reforge my coding skills so that I have the necessary tools to undergo my goal of becoming a professional software engineer. These Journal entries will be written informally as a way for me to organize my thoughts and allow others/potential future employers to explore my way of thinking and/or problem solving skills.

I will start off with committing this markdown file to my github and continue onward to create a webpage that will further organize and outline my journey to come.

Realizations - Need to reacclimate myself into getting into the flow of day-to-day coding again, including using git and github, creating commits, branches, etc.

I started with creating a repository with this journal entry file, a basic README, and the MIT license.

I think I should create a basic HTML and CSS file to start this project. I must also remember how to organize my respositories, and for that I'm going to revisit some of my earlier projects from my coding bootcamp. It seems like I used to have an assets folder that had CSS, JS, and other necessary subfolders so I'll apply that to my repository and create my boilerplate within.
